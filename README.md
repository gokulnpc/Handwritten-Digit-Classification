# Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Networks

This web app is a simple handwritten digit classification model built using a neural network with the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 small square 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web app is built using Streamlit.
